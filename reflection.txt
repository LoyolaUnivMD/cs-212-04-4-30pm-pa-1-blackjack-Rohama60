What is the most challenging thing you experienced?
- Since I didn't know how to play black jack it was challenging for me a bit more since I needed to learn the game and
learn how to code it. Also using the array list was challenging since I was just getting to understand it.

How did you overcome it? Anything you would do differently given what you know now.
- I had to watch few videos to understand the game and how it's played and for the array thing, I was able to use my notes
and search more about it to understand how it worked.

What did you like about working with classes and what was difficult?
- Classes makes my codes more organize and easy to use I would say. It takes time to get use to it but after you understand
it, it is good using classes.

How you felt about the step up in difficulty between this and PA0.
- It was very different and a big step up from PA0 and much more difficult since array was added to this one and also random.
